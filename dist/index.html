<hr><p>
In 1989 I started this little computer project, building an own 6502
computer. After a long break I started working on it again in 1996.
I wrote an own operating system for it which I have also ported to the 
Commodore 64.
In the meantime it has grown a lot, featuring a standard library,
relocatable files, multithreading/multitasking and much more.
