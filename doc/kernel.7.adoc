= GeckOS V2.0 Kernel Interface Description
(c) 1989-98 Andre Fachat

== Introduction
This document gives an overview on the GeckOS V2 kernel interface.

I try to keep this documentation as correct and up-to-date as possible,
but if in doubt, read the source... 

There are comments like "this need not be available in all
OS implementations". These comments mostly refer to the embedded
versions of the OS where the kernel can be shortened to (almost)
2k in size by leaving out some stuff not necessary for the particular
application.

== Kernel Interface Description

Most kernel routines return an error code in the accumlator (a), if the
carry flag is reset upon return. Otherwise the ac might contain data.

Please note that, in the real system the address could be basically anywhere depending on the
architecture. The loader relocates them on the basis of the *OSA2KERNEL*
label: the file contains it as undefined label, and the loader relocates
the kernel addresses that are stored as offset to this base as appropriate.
In this table only the offsets to the kernel jump table label *OSA2KERNEL* are given.

== HISTORY
The change from kernel 1.3 to kernel 2.0 is radical in some things, but 
conservative in others. The complete environment handling has been 
rewritten to make it easier to port to different platforms. Also threads
have been introduced. Therefore all the memory management and 
interprocess communication calls have changed as well.
The scheduler is now a lot faster, as no more checks are done for threads
in the waiting list. 

Although most routines have been rewritten, many of these calls still
have the same parameters and behave the same way.
Also the *PCBUF* is still used (unfortunately). This is the general
communications buffer needed for filesystem operation and some kernel
calls. It is  a global buffer, and as such it is protected by the
*SEM_SENDBUF* system semaphore. Each task that wants to use
has to allocate this semaphore with *PSEM* before using the
buffer.

Also there still is no block oriented communication, although the 
stream based communication has been improved by the out-of-band
error, brk and push/pull flags.
