== NAME
porting - how to port GeckOS onto a new architecture

== DESCRIPTION
Porting has been made much easier with this kernel version. In general, there is a proto architecture subdirectory that holds some prototype files for a non-MMU system. that can easily be changed to fit own needs.

Note:: the proto files are not fully maintained, so a maintained architecture should be used as basis if possible. 

The kernel needs two files in the arch/*/kernel subdirectory, namely kenv.a65 and kinit.a65. The kinit.a65 file is included in the kernel startup code, i.e. after setting the interrupt flag and clearing the decimal flag this file is executed, and it is expected that the CPU gets out of this file at the end of it.

=== kinit.a65
This file must initialize the stack, the memory management and mapping of the system ROM and RAM. Then the system preemption timer must be set up. When including kernel/zerotest.a65 and kernel/ramtest.a65 here all the memory options from above are available. Also the ramtest file returns the size of memory found in 256-byte blocks in a. This value must be passed to the end of the init routine in this file.

In addition to this some Macros have to be defined, that are used in the kernel later. 

----
  	GETFREQ()	returns a=0 for 1Mhz, a=128 for 2MHz
  	LEDPORT		address of LED port to signal hardware failures
  	LED_LED		bit of LED bit in LEDPORT address
  	H_ERROR()	if LEDPORT is not defined, then H_ERROR replaces
    	                the LED toggle routine if needed.
  	CLRTIMER()	clear the system preemption timer interrupt
  	KERNELIRQ()	returns if an interrupt occured in the kernel
     	                or outside. Is checked by "BNE IRQ_in_Kernel"
  	SAVEMEM()	save system mem config for interrupt
  	RESTOREMEM()	restore system mem config after interrupt
  	STARTMEM()	This is used to alloc/enable memory pages found
     	                during kernel init. Takes mem size in AC as given
   	                by the kernel init. It is called _after_ inimem!

----

=== kenv.a65
The kenv.a65 file is included in another part of the kernel. It is the part that maps the memory according to the environment number for each task. Several routines must be defined here: 

----
	inienv		init environment handling
	setthread	set active thread
	initsp		init task for thread (no in xr)
	push		push a byte to active threads stack 
	pull		pull a byte from active threads stack
	memtask		jump to active thread
	memsys		enter kernel

	getenv		get e free environment
	freenv		free an environmen
	sbrk		reduce/increase process memory in an environment

	enmem		enable memory blocks for environments
			(this kernel call is used for MMU systems and
			heavily system specific)
	setblk		sets a specific memory block in the memory map	
			of the active task. Also for MMU systems only

----
Also some macros must be defined:

----
	MEMTASK2()	This is equivalent to memtask above, but it
			is used for returns from interrupt
	MAPSYSBUF	maps the PCBUF of the active task to the
			address given by SYSBUF in system memory
	SYSBUF		mapped tasks PCBUF
	MAPENV()	maps the address given in a/y in env x to somewhere
			in the kernel map, returns mapped address in a/y
	MAPAENV()	as MAPENV, but does it for actual env.
	GETTASKMEM	returns (in AC) how much memory a task has
			(task id in y)
	CPPCBUFRX	copies PCBUF from other task (yr) to active one
	CPPCBUFTX	copies PCBUF from active task to another one (yr)
	CPFORKBUF()	copies the PCBUF from the FORK call to the task.
	GETACTENV()	returns active environment in ac
----
The full descriptions can be found in the C64 kenv file for example. This may look complicated, but it isn't. If you have a simple 6502 system without memory management, just copy (or set a link) to the C64 file. If you have a more complicated system, have a look at the CS/A65 file. 

=== Memory setup

One of the first decisions to be made is the memory setup. 

Plain:: 
	I systems with up to 64k of memory (potentially after re-mapping some ROM), a plain memory map like in the C64 or the PET32k can be used. 

Partial map:: 
	Other options are with partially mapped memory, similar to the CBM8296 (which actually has two banks of RAM in the upper 32k only). 
	In this case system tasks are managed in one mapped bank, with only zeropage, lib6502 and kernel in shared memory. The user programs are loaded into the second bank, that, together with the rest of the not-mapped RAM, makes 
	up a larger linear address space. The kenv.a65 code must switch between the banks appropriately.

Full map::
	In the CS/A machine, the memory can be re-mapped in blocks of 4k. This means every task can have its own zeropage and stack. The kenv.a65 code above must handle this as well. 
	In this port, the memtask code for example re-maps all the MMU entries. During processing of the kernel calls, the kernel may even map task memory into the kernel space.

When porting, it may be good to start with a plain setup to get a grip on porting the devices and filesystems, before venturing into more complicated setups. As mentioned above, the C64 implementation is a good start for that (see also build below).

=== Porting Devices

If the system that is ported to has a (linearly) memory mapped screen buffer, the devices/console.a65 console code can be used as starter. It includes architecture-specific code to map from ASCII (the system code table) to a
system-specific table if needed, and other functions. You can use arch/pet32k/con_pet.a65 as an example. This again includes other files e.g. for keyboard mapping and the blinking cursor.

If there is another type of mapping (e.g. Apple-II with non-linear screen buffer space), or even non-mapped video buffer, a new device needs to be written.

Devices are built into a single block (that comes from the 4k block mapping in GeckOS original CS/A implementation) that is initialized during kernel init. The architecture-specific devices are defined in arch/c64devices/c64dev.a65 or arch/pet32k/devices.a65 for example. 

=== Porting Filesystems

The currently supported filesystems support Commodore IEC/IEEE devices, PC floppy disks with FAT12 format (using a WD1771 controller), and the devices filesystem.

==== Devices

The devices filesystem uses the the kernel *DEVCMD* interface to show device names and handle them. Note: that includes the mapping between device names and numbers. So, this should be relatively generic. On the other hand, if *FSDEV_NOROM* is not set, it also shows the content of the init ROM and allows to access its content. 

Note:: The init ROM access will probably be replaced at some point, so it is recommended to just use *FSDEV_NOROM*.

==== Storage

Depending on the target architecture, the filesystem code needs to be re-writting, if none of the existing code can be re-used.

To implement a new filesystem driver, the API described in include/fdefs.a65 needs to be implemented. Existing filesystems could be used as reference, but note that the codebase is very old and messy.

=== Setting up the build process

Three main components need to be loaded into the target system:

* The kernel
* lib6502
* init ROM

The kernel provides the entry points into the system by providing the *OSA2KERNEL* API. The lib6502 provides the lib6502 calls by providing the *LIB6502* API. 
Note that the kernel and the lib6502 are re-entrant and only need to be in memory once, even if used in multiple tasks.

The Init ROM contains all the extra code to be executed. The first block typically are the devices, then the *init* program and the *fsdev* filesystem. After that come further filesystems and other programs to be started without access to storage. Each ROM entry has a type attached. The kernel starts types PK_DEV and PK_INIT. This is typically only the device block and the *init* program. 

The *init* program then scans the init ROM again, and starts the other tasks (like *PK_PRG*, or *PK_FS* filesystems). For this, the *init* program needs to "see" the init ROM in its memory mapping. Note, that *init* already uses *lib6502*.

In a plain setting, where no memory mapping is involved, all three items can be combined into a single binary, as is the case in the C64 or PET32k architectures. 
Typically a *rom.o65* is produced that is relocated to the target address, loaded into memory in one blob, potentially re-located by a loader, and then started by calling the KERNEL's *RESET* entry.
During relocation it must be ensured that the three segments - text, data, bss - do not overlap, by adjusting the options to *reloc65*.
During the build, the kernel and lib6502 APIs may be located anywhere, but the lib6502 loader automatically relocates the calls from any binary by using the *OSA2KERNEL* and *LIB6502* to the correct address that is "baked into" the lib6502 code.

Note:: for the ROM build the .data segment is not initialized!

In other settings, three binaries for kernel, lib6502, and init ROM can be produced separately, but must be controlled from the build process (Makefile). For example the *OSA2KERNEL* and *LIB6502* addresses should be defined and given to the build using the "-D" option to *xa65*. These can then be loaded separately into memory, moved, and then started by a loader as can be see in the *cbm8x96* architecture.
