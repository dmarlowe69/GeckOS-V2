== NAME
c64 - describes the GeckOS port to the C64

== DESCRIPTION
The C64 is a machine that has a single environment with almost 60k usable RAM, and no memory management unit.


== BUILDING
To build the program, you have to have the 6502 cross assembler 'xa' in version 2.4.1 or later.
Current testing takes place on 'VICE' (x64), the versatile Commodore emulator.

In the file c64rom/c64rom.a65, a few options can be set by setting
the defines appropriately. See doc/build.html.

Go to the arch/c64/boot directory and type "make" this will build
all necessary files in this directory, including links to all
important applications. Typing "make osa.d64" will produce a
d64 disk image with all necessary files. This disk image can be
transfered to a C64 and used.

If you change something in the code and reassemble, check from the file65
output that the data and bss segments don't overlap. Also the
memory that is dynamically allocated starts at $1600 (see
arch/c64/c64rom.a65). Only if nothing overlaps there is no danger.

See also *build(7)*.

=== BUILD OPTIONS

==== Parallel IEEE488
I have an original C64 parallel IEEE488 expansion board, so that
I use this for better performance. I also implemented the hardware
emulation for the CBM IEEE488 interface for the C64 in the VICE
Commodore emulator (from version 0.11 on). So if you have this interface,
use it for better file transfer performance on the real C64 or
for file access in VICE. Change the line in c64rom/c64rom.a65 from
'#undef PARALLEL' to '#define PARALLEL'. For the C64, the
devices 9 to 11 are mapped to the drives c: to f:

== BOOTING
In VICE (i.e. x64) or on the C64 load the (BASIC) program 'loader', which
is in the boot directory and the osa.d64 disk image. When run, this
program loads the charom, the program ROM and
a small machine language program (boot.obj, which is made from
boot.a65). It then starts the boot routine that copies the ROMs to
their places and jumps to the kernel RESET routine.

When using osa.d64 in VICE, you have to enable the true1541 emulation.

== USAGE
The video device is able to handle up to three screen output windows.
The C= key switches between the different windows (You can change the
switch key in arch/c64/devices/con_c64.a65, but when you're using
the "C=" key, don't try to use the Ctrl-Alt-Fx keys in XFree when the
mouse cursor is in the vice window. GeckOS will detect a Ctrl-Switchkey
and therefore send an EOF to the program....)

On the first window, a lib6502  "lsh" is started. On the second one, the
old shell is started. As the C64 has no MMU, these two programs
have to use different memory locations. The shell is assembled into the
ROM and can be started only once from the ROM. The lsh is a lib6502
program and is loaded by the init process. The ROM only contains a
command to the init process to start the lib6502 program. It uses
a relocatable fileformat and can thus started more than once.

In the shell you can use "c:ls" on drives a: (registered devides) and
b: (rom inventory). If the iec bus works, then drive c: is disk unit 8
and drive d: is disk unit 9, till drive f: is device 11.

For the shell commands see the docs.
The memory map is described below. When writing and using lib6502
programs they are relocated automagically.

== ROM CONFIGURATION
The "ROM" is a boot image that is loaded into memory from ROMSTART to end of memory, where the C64 ROMs are 
completely mapped out and only RAM is used. In $dxxx of course the I/O area is used.

The configuration can be seen in arch/c64/c64rom.a65.

=== INCLUDED PROGRAMS
The ROM contains these blocks

devices/c64dev.a65::
	This contains the device handlers supported by the C64 architecture (see below)
sysapps/init/init.a65::
	The init program that starts all other progams, and is also able to restart them when they finish.
	See *startup(7)*
sysapps/fs/fsdev.a65::
	A filesystem driver that allows accessing devices as files (see *fsdev(8)*).
	Depending on configuration it also allows to access ROM content.
sysapps/fs/fsiec.a65::
	The filesystem driver for the IEC or IEEE488 interface of the C64.
	Note that usually the serial IEC is used. Using the *PARALLEL* define, instead the 
	Commodore IEEE488 interface module is supported.
	*fsiec(8)* uses CIA2 Timer B as serial bus timeout timer.
sysapps/mon/mon.a65::
	Old style shell program. Will be gone at some point.
slipd::
	This program is (optionally, depending on *INETSTART*) loaded from disk into memory during boot and started.
lsh::
	This program is loaded from disk into memory and started.

=== SYSTEM SEMAPHORES
These are the system semaphores defined in the C64 port
Any program to access the named resource should aqcuire the relevant semaphore before doing so

SEM_SERIEC::
	Serial IEC interface. 
SEM_PARIEC::
	Parallel IEEE488 interface (when available)

SEM_CIA2TB::
	Will be defined as SEM_SERIEC, as fsiec uses this timer for its timeout handling

== KERNEL CONFIGURATION
The kernel is configured with these major configuration options:

STACKCOPY:: 
	The stack is divided into two parts - one for the system and one for userspace programs. 
	During context switch the userspace stack is copied over into a save area and the stack area
	from another task is copied in. This allows for an arbitrary number of tasks (in theory).

NMIDEV::
	Supports devices that run in the NMI (needed for the RS232 interfaces).

=== SYSTEM INTERRUPT
The C64 kernel uses the VIC-II raster timing interrupt as a 50Hz interrupt source.

== SUPPORTED DEVICES
This section describes the devices supported by GeckOS.

=== VIDEO
The video device provides three virtual consoles.

==== VIDEO OUTPUT
Video output is taken from the video buffers at $exxx (see memory map above), with a 40 column, 25 rows display,
using the C64's built-in VIC-II chip.

==== KEYBOARD MAPPING
The keyboard is mapped such that it can run on the real hardware, but also in the real machine.
Here are the important key mappings:

C=::
	switch between virtual consoles 
Ctrl::
	The Ctrl-key.
Pound::
	The pound symbol on the C64 enters the pipe symbol in GeckOS. 

Here is a comparison of the real machine, VICE and what GeckOS uses.

|GeckOS|C64|VICE on PC (3.4+)

|Console switch | Ctrl + C= | Left Ctrl + Tab 
|Console mode | Shift + C= | Shift + Tab 
|Logoff  | Shift + Ctrl + C= | Shift + Left Ctrl + Tab 
|\| | Pound | \| 
|====

=== SER
The serial devices supported are based on the 9600 baud userport interface, the 6551 ACIA chip, and the 16550 UART.

==== 9600 baud userport
This device, usually "ser1", utilizes the 9600 baud interface by Daniel Dallmann. The two shift registers of the
two CIAs are used to shift out and shift in the data. A clever NMI routine that trigger on the incoming start bit 
and starts the shift-in of the data on the CIA's SDR makes this possible. This device needs the NMIDEV kernel 
configuration.

==== ACIA-based (classic)
The so-called classic ACIA describes my use of the ACIA in the C64. It uses the DSR input of the ACIA
as CTS input, to avoid the ACIA disabling receiver and transmitter when CTS is set. 

The definition of *ACIABASE* defines the base address of the ACIA and enables it. 
I originally had it in a circuit that I
put between the SID and the motherboard, so it was at $d600. 

NOTE: only low speeds (about 2400 baud) can be achieved due to the use of the IRQ interrupt instead of NMI.

==== ACIA-based (swiftlink)
This interface uses a swiftlink compatible module with ACIA, using the NMI routine to achieve the necessary speed.

Swift link must be configured to $de00, and using the NMI interrupt.


==== UART-based 
After the disappointing results with the ACIA, replaced it with a 16550 UART, that has a 16 byte input buffer.

Defining *UARTBASE* includes this device driver.
