:doctype: manpage

== NAME
dup - re-open a file by creating a new file descriptor for it

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X: old STDIO file nr (STDIN, STDOUT, or STDERR)
Call::
	jsr dup
Output::
	* C=0
		** X: new file descriptor
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
This call 'reopens' a file, i.e. it returns a new file-nr that is used as the old one. They share the same read/write pointers etc. Both file-nrs must be closed. This way the same file can be given to STDOUT and STDERR in a fork call, for example.

If dup is given a read-write file-nr, both sides are duped and the returned file-nr is bi-directional again.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOFILE:: 
	not a valid file number
