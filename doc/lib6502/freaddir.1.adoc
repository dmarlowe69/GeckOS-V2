== NAME
freaddir - read a directory entry

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X - stream number
	* A/Y address of buffer
Call::
	jsr freaddir
Output::
	* C=0
		** struct given in A/Y is updated with new buffer address and reduced length of at least FD_NAME+MAX_FILENAME bytes.
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
Reads a single directory entry into the given buffer.

reads _one_ directory entry into the buffer, which is
of length (FD_NAME + MAX_FILENAME)
One entry consists of a directory struct:

----

                .word   0               ; valid bits
                .word   0               ; owner ID
                .word   0               ; group ID
                .word   0               ; permissions (drwxrwxrwx) (2 byte)
                .word   0,0             ; file length in byte (4 byte)
                .byt    0,0,0,0,0,0     ; last modification date
                                        ; (year-1990, month, day, hr, min, sec)
----

The valid bit say, which entry in the struct is valid.
bit 0 is for the permissions, bit 1 for the file length, bit 2
for the date. The file length, if not zero, is an
approximate value (like the blocks *254 in a vc1541)
this struct is followed by the null-terminated filename.
The valid bits are:

----
                FDV_PERM        1
                FDV_LENGTH      2
                FDV_MDATE       4
                FDV_OWNER       8
                FDV_GROUP       16
----

If permissions are valid, but not group/owner, then
the permissions for user and group are invalid, and the
permissions for others should be taken.

The directory entry struct definitions are:

----
                FD_VALID        0       /* 1 byte */
                FD_PERM         1       /* 2 byte */
                FD_LENGTH       3       /* 4 byte */
                FD_MDATE        7       /* 6 byte */
                FD_NAME         13      /* null-terminated */

                The permission bits are actually a copy from the Linux
                man pages...:

                S_ISUID         $800    /* set user ID on execution */
                S_ISGID         $400    /* set group ID on execution */
                S_ISVTX         $200    /* -- (sticky bit) */

                S_IRWXU         $1c0    /* rwx mask for user */
                S_IRUSR         $100    /* read by owner */
                S_IWUSR         $080    /* write by owner */
                S_IXUSR         $040    /* exexute by owner */

                S_IRWXG         $038    /* rwx mask for group */
                S_IRGRP         $020    /* read by group */
                S_IWGRP         $010    /* write by group */
                S_IXGRP         $008    /* execute by group */

                S_IRWXO         $007    /* rwx mask for others */
                S_IROTH         $004    /* read by others */
                S_IWOTH         $002    /* write by others */
                S_IXOTH         $001    /* execute by others */

                S_IFMT          $f000   /* file type mask */
                S_IFSOCK        $c000   /* socket */
                S_IFLNK         $a000   /* symbolic link */
                S_IFREG         $8000   /* regular file */
                S_IFBLK         $6000   /* block device */
                S_IFDIR         $4000   /* directory */
                S_IFCHR         $2000   /* character device */
                S_IFIFO         $1000   /* fifo */

                S_IFMNAME       $3000   /* media name */
                S_IFMFREE       $5000   /* free are on media */
                S_IFMSIZE       $7000   /* media size */
----

Most of the file types are probably not implemented
on a 6502 system. But before defining new types, one
should keep the already defined values save.
That's for the last three entries, which are not
Posix standards.

The length field can be an approximate if it is not zero
and the length is not valid (For VC1541 block lengths).

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOFILE:: 
	file not open
E_EMPTY::
	if non-blocking, when no bytes are available
E_EOF::
	end of file
