== DESCRIPTION
Opens a directory for reading. The parameter given is the device, directory path, and optionally a filename filter.
Files are named as: "Device:directory/filenamefilter", where Device depends on the OS.

The filesystem might imply other limitations on filename length, if there are directories at all, or the allowed characters. Wildcards are "*" that match any string and "?" that match exacly one character. The interpretation might depend on the filesystem, i.e. may not even be the same on the same system, but on different devices. Escape sequences are "\*" and "\?". Escape sequence for "\" is "\\". 

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.
