== NAME
fcntl - file control

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X: file nr
	* A: operation
		** FC_PUSH=0: all buffers are flushed
		** FC_PULL=1: pull in all data available
		** FC_RCHECK=2: check if data is available to read
		** FC_WCHECK=3: check if at least a single byte can be written
Call::
	jsr fcntl
Output::
	* C=0: Ok
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
*fcntl* allows pushing and pulling of data, as well as checking whether data is available. 

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOTIMP::
	Call not implemented
E_NOFILE:: 
	not a valid file descriptor
E_NOREAD::
	Not a read file (for FC_PULL, RC_RCHECK)
E_NOWRITE::
	Not a write file (for FC_PUSH, RC_WCHECK)

NOTE: The fcntl return code should be ignored, as it is probably not implemented in most of the systems, except for RCHECK/WCHECK calls of course.
