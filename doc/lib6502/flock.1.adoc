== NAME
flock - lock a file for access from other tasks

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X: file nr
	* A: operation
		** LOCK_SH: shared lock
		** LOCK_EX: exclusive lock
		** LOCK_UN: unlock
	* C=0: don't block
	* C=1: block until lock can be got
Call::
	jsr flock
Output::
	* C=0: ok, no error
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
The flock call locks a file for other tasks access. If locked shared, then other tasks may also aquire shared locks - for reading, for example. An exclusive lock can only be aquired by exactly one task at a time - for writing. An exclusive lock can not be obtained when there are other shared locks, but a pending exclusive lock blocks all other attempts to lock it, even for shared locks. The flock implementation should be fair, i.e. lock attempts are served in the order they arrive, except that exclusive get served before shared locks. The flock call is optional. If not implemented, return E_NOTIMP 

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOTIMP::
	Call not available
E_NOFILE:: 
	no file descriptor available
E_LOCKED::
	if non-blocking, file is already locked
