== NAME
fseek - change position within a file

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X - stream number
	* A/Y address of struct: .byt mode; .word offset_lo, offset_hi
Call::
	jsr fseek
Output::
	* C=0: ok
	* C=1: AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
Move the read/write pointer within a file.

The address given to the call points to a structure that describes how to move the read/write pointer.
The first byte is a mode that defines how to move the pointer:

FSEEK_ABS:: 0 - count the position from the beginning of the file (must be positive)
FSEEK_END:: 1 - count the position from the end of the file (must be negative)
FSEEK_REL:: 2 - count from the current position (positive or negative)

After that the struct contains a four byte signed integer that describes the offset.

There are, however, files that cannot be seeked, namely character devices. If trying to use fseek on such a device, E_NOSEEK is returned. 

NOTE: If a seekable file is given to STDIN and STDOUT/STDERR, the behaviour is not defined. Only non-seekable files should be given to STDIN and STDOUT/STDERR, when opened read-write.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOFILE:: 
	file not open
E_NOSEEK::
	File cannot be seeked.
E_ILLPAR::
	applying the seek offset results in an illegal position (before the start, or after the end of the file).

NOTE: In the case of E_ILLPAR, the resulting position in the file is undefined.
