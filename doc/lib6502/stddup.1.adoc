== NAME
stddup - replace a standard I/O stream with another stream

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X: old STDIO file nr (STDIN, STDOUT, or STDERR)
	* Y: new file descriptor
Call::
	jsr stddup
Output::
	* C=0
		** X: old file descriptor
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
This call replaces a stdio file-nr (the pre-defined STDIN, STDOUT, and STDERR file-nrs) with a new file-nr. The old file-nr must not be closed, as it is when the process terminates. Instead the new file-nr returned must be closed.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOFILE:: 
	not a valid file number
