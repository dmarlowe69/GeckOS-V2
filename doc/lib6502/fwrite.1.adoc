== NAME
fwrite - write a buffer to a stream

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* X - stream number
	* A/Y address of struct: .word buffer_address; .word length_of_buffer
	* C - block flag
		** C=0 - return immediately even if nothing or only a partial buffer is written
		** C=1 - block until the full buffer has been written
Call::
	jsr fwrite
Output::
	* C=0
		** struct given in A/Y is updated with new buffer address and reduced length
	* C=1
		** AC - error code 

NOTE: modifies all registers

== DESCRIPTION
Write a number of bytes into a given buffer

When calling *fwrite* a struct is given, that points to information on the buffer. That struct
contains the address of the buffer and the length of the buffer.

On return, the struct is updated - the buffer address is increased by the number of bytes 
read, and the length of the buffer is reduced by the number of bytes read.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_NOFILE:: 
	file not open
E_EMPTY::
	if non-blocking, when no bytes are available
E_NUL::
	stream is closed from the reading side
