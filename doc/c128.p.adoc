== NAME
GeckOS C128 Notes

== DESCRIPTION

The Commodore 128 (C128) has two banks of 64k memory. 

The C128 port is based in parts on the C64 port (mostly devices), and the CS/A port due to the ability to 
handle multiple environments.

== Quickstart

In the downloaded GeckOS directory, run *make runc128* to automatically build the *geckos128.d64* disk image in the *arch/c128/boot* directory, and autostart it in the VICE *x128* emulator, in 40 column mode.
Alternatively, use *make runc128f* to build and run it in 2 MHz, 80 column mode with 1571 disk drive (enables fast serial IEC).

== Memory Map

The C128 uses shared memory on the top of memory, containing the kernel code, the kernel variables, and
the lib6502 code.

== BUILDING
Building the images is simple. Just go to the arch/c128/boot
directory and type "make". This should build all files.
"make geckos128.d64" should make a d64 VC1541 disk image with all necessary files.
You have to have my new XA version in the path, though.

To customize the ROM, change edit rom.a65 in arch/c128. You can gain some
memory when you remove the shell/monitor from the ROM image.
(You could replace it with the lib6502 monitor "mon" to be loaded like
"lsh".)
When running "make" then the command "file65" should print the addresses
used for the different segments. They must not overlap. 

To move the lib6502 RAM area, edit the values for +Memstart, Memend+
and +Zerostart+ at the end of rom.a65.
To move the segments, edit the Makefile and change the addresses for the 
segments in the XA calls. The text segment address must be two below
the actual start as it also counts the two byte starting address used
for loading. In addition you have to edit the value for the definition
of ROMSTART in rom.a65.

=== BOOT
Put the files "loader", "lsh", "rom.bin", "lib.bin" and "kern.bin" on a disk accessible by the 
PET 8x96. load "loader" into BASIC memory and start it (probably edit 
it for the right load device number). This boots OS/A65.
