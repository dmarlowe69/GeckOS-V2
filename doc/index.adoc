= GeckOS/A65 Operating System 
Version 2.0.1 (c) 1989-1998 Andr&eacute; Fachat 

== Introduction
GeckOS is a unix-alike multitasking and multithreading operating system
for the 6502.

Version 2 is an extensive rewrite and has a lot of new features:

* multithreading
* dynamic memory management
* relocatable fileformat
* lib6502 standard library
* internet support

== Quickstart

. Either 
** Download and unpack the GeckOS source distribution from http://www.6502.org/users/andre/osa/index.html[6502.org].
** Clone the https://github.com/fachat/GeckOS-V2[Github repository]
. Download and install the xa65 cross-assembler. On Linux, xa is usually included in the distribution. Alternatively download from https://www.floodgap.com/retrotech/xa/[xa65 site]. 
. For the Commodore ports, download and install the VICE emulator. Usually VICE is included in Linux distributions, but ROMs may have to be provided separately. If you want, download, build and install it from the https://sourceforge.net/projects/vice-emu/[VICE homepage].
. In the unpacked GeckOS directory, type "make runc64" to build the system, and run it in the VICE x64 emulator. For other ports use 'make runcbm8x96' for the PET 8296 port, 'make runpet32k' for the PET 32k demo, 'make runc128' for the 1 MHz / 40 col C128 version, or 'make runc128f' for the 2 MHz / 80 col / 1571 C128 version.

== Description
GeckOS/A65 is a full-featured Multitasking/Multithreading operating system
for the 6502. It is preemptive and implements some Unix-like features, 
like 
link:signals.7.adoc[signals], link:semaphores.7.adoc[semaphores], 
link:fileformat.html[relocatable fileformat],
link:lib6502.html[standard library], link:slip.7.adoc[internet support] via
a kind of simplified sockets and last but not least virtual consoles.

It is extremly scalable. Stripped down to the scheduler and interrupt
handling the kernel is only slightly above 2k. In normal 
link:embedded.html[embedded systems]
the kernel has around 4k, with only application programs running. 
Full featured systems have a 4k kernel, and several support tasks
provided system services like TCP/SLIP and (different) filesystems.

The kernel is almost completely hardware independent. All the 
architecture-specific stuff is in a separate subdirectory
for each architecture.

The link:lib6502.html[lib6502] as standard library allows easy 
access to the system services. Parts of this library are already 
implemented in another 6502 operating system, Lunix by Daniel Dallmann.
This way source code compatibility is achieved.

Version 2.0.0 features a "slipd" server process that brings easy internet
access to all lib6502 programs, that can now access TCP connections
like files. A stable WWW server running on the OS is built into the
slipd daemon. Also a remote login can be done. This way the OS can run
programs to for example read sensors and write the stuff to files, which
are exported by the WWW server.

The link:fileformat.html[relocatable o65 fileformat] used by the lib6502 standard library
in version 2.0.0 allows more than one instance of a program being run 
at the same time without interference, even without virtual memory.
Also the very same binaries runs on all supported platforms (if they do not
use architecture specific stuff, but lib6502 calls only).

== Architectures
GeckOS is a microkernel architecture. It uses a small kernel that mainly
provides the inter-process communication and the scheduling between
tasks. Anything else is done in separate tasks (or processes in other
operating systems).

The following diagram gives an overview on the architecture:

----
    ---------- --------- --------- ------- --------
    |  fsdev | | fsiec | | fsibm | | lsh | | lmon | tasks...
    |        | |       | |       | -------------------------------------
    |        | |       | |       | |  lib6502
    ---------- --------- --------- -------------------------------------
    ---------------------------- -------------- ----- ---------- --------
    |          |               | |    fsm     | |   | |        | |      |
    |          |      env      | -------------- |   | |        | |      |
    |          |               ------------------   | | stream | | mem  |
    |          |                                    | |        | |      |
    |          -------------------------------------- |        | |      |
    |             devices                           | |        | |      |
    ------------------------------------------------- ---------- --------
    --------- ------- ----------- ----------
    | video | | par | | spooler | | serial | devices...
    --------- ------- ----------- ----------
----
The kernel is divided into multiple modules that work together and faciliate the
communication between the devices (like console (video), serial, ...) and
the different tasks.

A Task can be a system task like a filesystem driver (like *fsiec(8)* or *fsdev(8)*),
or user space tasks like *lsh(1)* or *lmon(1)*. File commands like *ls(1)* or *mkdir(1)*,
and filters like *wc(1)*, *hexdump(1)* etc are implemented as separate tasks.
Userspace programs usually use the link:lib6502.html[Lib6502] as mediator between
application and kernel.

For more information please see the (older but still useful) description in
link:historic/oa1.html[OS/A65 V1 Architecture].
The supported devices are described in link:devices.7.adoc[Devices].

System architectures with and without MMU are described in 
link:mmu.7.adoc[MMU] and link:nommu.7.adoc[No-MMU].

== Networking
GeckOS supports TCP/IP networking through an own TCP/IP stack.
For details see link:slip.7.adoc[SLIP].

== Ports
For porting GeckOS to other architectures, please look at these sections:

* link:porting.7.adoc[Porting]
* link:mmu.7.adoc[MMU]
* link:nommu.7.adoc[No-MMU]
* link:embedded.7.adoc[Embedded Systems]

For current ports, please look at

* link:c64.p.adoc[c64]
* link:pet32k.p.adoc[pet32k]
* link:cbm8x96.p.adoc[cbm8x96]
* link:c128.p.adoc[c128]
* link:csa65.p.adoc[CS/A65] (my self-built computer with MMU)

== Development
For the development of OS/A65 programs there are two possibilities:

* link:lib6502.html[lib6502] with the link:fileformat.html[o65 file format]
This allows source compatibility (to some degree) with Lunix, as
well as that the program runs on all supported platforms.
lib6502 programs are simply assembled with my xa65 crossassembler with the
including the file "lib6502.i65" and the assembler option "-LLIB6502" set. 
This tells the compiler to put "LIB6502" into the
file as undefined reference that is resolved when loading. The lib6502
jump table is relative to this address. 

* A system application not only uses lib6502 calls (if it uses them)
but also link:kernel.7.adoc[kernel] calls. The kernel can be at 
different addresses for different
architecture as well. Therefore you have to add "-LOSA2KERNEL" to the assembler
line. This address is also resolved when loading. If the file should also 
be used as a ROM file, then it has to have a ROM boot header, see the
kernel description.

More information on how to build can be found in
link:build.7.adoc[Build].

== History
I didn't dream of this becoming such a nice project when I started
building http://www.6502.org/users/andre/csa/index.html[this computer] in 1989.

After someone asked me to release it to the public, I decided
to put it under the link:../COPYING[GNU public license].
(Which, of course, doesn't hold true for the ported BASIC interpreter, which
is taken from the C64.
See link:../sysapps/basic.1.adoc[basic.1.adoc] for more.) Also the 
character ROMs are taken from the C64. However, Commodore in its old
form doesn't exist anymore and attempts to contact the new right holders
have not brought any success, so I put them here.

Well, when I did this project, it was just for fun. But now I find it
quite nice. Well, if you know some magazin that would like to publish
some of it, I will be glad writing an article or so (if anybody really
wants it ;-)

== Ideas for later versions
Ideas, proposals and bug reports are collected and managed on github in the
