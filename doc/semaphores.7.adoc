== NAME
semaphores - usage

== DESCRIPTION
Semaphores are used to protect critical sections of data or a system resource from concurrent modification.
GeckOS provides two types of semaphores, that can be used with the same kernel interface:

system semaphores::
	As defined during the build process, using negative semaphore numbers
application semaphores::
	These semaphores need to be allocated and freed after use. They use positive semaphore numbers.
	To allocate, use *GETSEM(2)*, to release it use *FRESEM(2)*

== USAGE
An system semaphore can be directly used using its system-defined semaphore number.
An application semaphore must first be allocated using *GETSEM(2)*.

Then a task that wants to use the protected resource, must call *PSEM(2)* to "pass" the semaphore.
Once passed, no other thread may pass the semaphore (even threads from the owning task).
A thread that calls *PSEM(2)* can decide whether it wants to block until it gets the semaphore,
or whether the call immediately returns.

Only when a thread of the task that has the semaphore has called *VSEM(2)*, one of the threads waiting on the
semaphore (having called the blocking variant of *PSEM(2)*) is woken up and its task is declared
owner of the semaphore.

NOTE: the PSEM and VSEM names come from the dutch names Dijkstra gave these operations.
 
=== LOCKING
GeckOS semaphores have an extra functionality - locking. Locking here means that only the locking
task can successfully pass the *PSEM(2)* call even if threads of other tasks are waiting.
This is specifically implemented for the shell, as the shell must fork multiple tasks for example
in a pipe. If that pipe includes a task that uses SENDBUF, and locks it, the shell is blocked.
This especially happens when *ps(1)* is piped into *more(1)*: *ps(1)* locks SENDBUF to get the 
information from the kernel, and tries to send the information through the pipe to *more*.
The shell, however, cannot fork the *more* program, as it requires the SENDBUF that is locked
by *ps*. So ps blocks writing to the pipe, and does not release SENDBUF, the shell cannot "open"
the pipe as it cannot get SENDBUF.

Therefore, the shell uses *LOCKSEM(2)* to lock the semaphore to its own task for the duration
it needs to build the pipeline. After that the shell releases the lock using *LOCKSEM(2)*, and 
any command that uses SENDBUF can run as intended.

=== SYSTEM SEMAPHORES

Currently only one architecture-independent system semaphore is defined:

SEM_SENDBUF::
	Protects the use of the *SENDBUF* structure at $0200 that is used for various 
	kernel calls like *FORK(2)* or *GETINFO(2)*

Other semaphores may be defined by the architecture port. See there for more information.

=== Special considerations

When a semaphore is aquired with *PSEM*, the kernel notes which task did this.
Only this task is allowed to do a *VSEM* on this semaphore.

Therefore, when a task dies, the semaphore it owns are freed, and potentially waiting
tasks are released (one of them passes the blocking *PSEM*).

The *SEM_SENDBUF* semaphore is used to protect the *PCBUF* buffer used by multiple kernel calls.
The kernel notes which task has this semaphore:

- On a FORK, the semaphore moves to the forked task, as the forked task needs to read its command line from the PCBUF. The forked task should then do a *VSEM*.
- During SEND/RECEIVE, the semaphore ownership moves to the receiver. 

Note:: a filesystem will not release *SEM_SENDBUF*, as it typically replies back with a new message, which transfers the semaphore back).


== RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
Semaphores are "unlocked" and "disowned" when a task dies, i.e. its last thread dies.
In this process waiting threads (of other tasks) may be woken up.
