= PET32K(P)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
pet32k - describes the GeckOS port to the Commodore PET with 32k (40 column graphics keyboard)

== DESCRIPTION
The PET is a machine that has a single environment with only 32k usable RAM, and no memory management unit.

WARNING: the following needs to be updated!

== BUILDING
To build the program, you have to have my 6502 cross assembler 'xa-2.1.4e'
Current testing takes place on 'VICE', the versatile Commodore emulator.

In the file rom.a65, a few options can be set by setting
the defines appropriately. See the link:build.7.adoc[build] section.

Go to the arch/c64/boot directory and type "make" this will build
all necessary files in this directory, including links to all
important applications. Typing "make osa.d64" will produce a
d64 disk image with all necessary files. This disk image can be
transfered to a C64 and used.

If you change something in the code and reassemble, check from the file65
output that the data and bss segments don't overlap. Also the
memory that is dynamically allocated starts at $1600 (see
arch/c64/c64rom.a65). Only if nothing overlaps there is no danger.

See also *build(7)*.

=== BUILD OPTIONS

== BOOTING
In VICE (i.e. xpet) or on the PET load the (BASIC) program 'loader', which
is in the boot directory and the osa.d64 disk image. When run, this
program loads the charom, the program ROM and
a small machine language program (boot.obj, which is made from
boot.a65). It then starts the boot routine that copies the ROMs to
their places and jumps to the kernel RESET routine.

== USAGE
The video device is able to handle up to two screen output consoles.
The Left-Shift+Rvs/Off key switches between the different virtual consoles.

On the first window, a lib6502  "lsh" is started. The lsh is a lib6502
program and is loaded by the init process. The ROM only contains a
command to the init process to start the lib6502 program. It uses
a relocatable fileformat and can thus started more than once.

In the shell you can use "c:ls" on drives a: (registered devides)
If the iec bus works, then drive b: is disk unit 8
and drive c: is disk unit 9.

For the shell commands see the docs.
The memory map is described below. When writing and using lib6502
programs they are relocated automagically.

== ROM CONFIGURATION
The "ROM" is a boot image that is loaded into memory from start of available memory.
The PET ROMs can of course not be replaced, so they still use the memory from $9000 and up.
Even the interrupt routine is started in the PET ROM, but the interrupt vectors are modified
to point to GeckOS.

In $e8xx of course the I/O area is used.

The configuration can be seen in arch/pet32k/rom.a65.

=== INCLUDED PROGRAMS
The ROM contains these blocks

devices/devices.a65::
	This contains the device handlers supported by the architecture (see below)
sysapps/init/init.a65::
	The init program that starts all other progams, and is also able to restart them when they finish.
	See *startup(7)*
sysapps/fs/fsdev.a65::
	A filesystem driver that allows accessing devices as files (see *fsdev(8)*).
	In this configuration, to save memory, ROM access is not built in.
sysapps/fs/fsiec.a65::
	The filesystem driver for the IEC or IEEE488 interface of the C64.
	Note that usually the serial IEC is used. Using the *PARALLEL* define, instead the 
	Commodore IEEE488 interface module is supported.
lsh::
	This program is loaded from disk into memory and started.

=== SYSTEM SEMAPHORES
These are the system semaphores defined in the C64 port
Any program to access the named resource should aqcuire the relevant semaphore before doing so

SEM_PARIEC::
	Parallel IEEE488 interface (when available)

== KERNEL CONFIGURATION
The kernel is configured with these major configuration options:

STACKCOPY:: 
	The stack is divided into two parts - one for the system and one for userspace programs. 
	During context switch the userspace stack is copied over into a save area and the stack area
	from another task is copied in. This allows for an arbitrary number of tasks (in theory).

=== SYSTEM INTERRUPT
The PET kernel uses a timer interrupt as a 50Hz interrupt source.

== SUPPORTED DEVICES
This section describes the devices supported by GeckOS.

=== VIDEO
The video device provides three virtual consoles.

==== VIDEO OUTPUT
Video output is taken from the video buffers at $exxx (see memory map above), with a 40 column, 25 rows display,
using the C64's built-in VIC-II chip.

==== KEYBOARD MAPPING
The keyboard is mapped such that it can run on the real hardware, but also in the real machine.

Here is a comparison of the real machine, VICE (3.4+) and what GeckOS uses.

[options="header",frame="top"]
|====
|GeckOS         | PET (Graphics kbd) | VICE (-model 4032) | PET (business kbd) | VICE (-model 8032)
|Ctrl           | Left Shift         | Left Shift 	  | Repeat	       | Right Ctrl
|Tab            | Rvs/Off            | Tab                | Tab                | Tab
|Console switch | (single) Shift + Rvs/Off | (single) Right Shift + Tab | Shift + Tab       | Shift + Tab
|Console mode   | (both) Shift + Rvs/Off | (both) Shift + Tab | Repeat + Tab      | Right Ctrl + Tab
|Logoff         | n/a | n/a | Shift + Repeat + Tab | Shift + Right Ctrl + Tab
|\|             | (both) Shift + y     | (both) Shift + y     | Repeat + y         | Right Ctrl + y
|====

NOTE: due to the missing extra control keys (or alternatives for them), the PET graphics keyboard uses both shift key as *Ctrl* and you cannot use *Ctrl* and *Shift* in combination.
