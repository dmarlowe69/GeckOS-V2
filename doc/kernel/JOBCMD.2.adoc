== NAME
JOBCMD - job control functions

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* AC - command number (see below)
	* XR - affected task number (depending on command)
Call::
	jsr JOBCMD
Output::
	* C=0 - success
		** AC=E_OK
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
	* YR - number of threads for a task for *JC_INFO*, preserved otherwise

NOTE: YR is preserved except for *JC_INFO*, XR and AC are used/modified.

== DESCRIPTION

This call implements various job control functions as follows. The JC number is the command number to be given
in AC to the call:

JC_BACKGROUND:: send the task given in XR into the background (if caller is parent)

JC_FOREGROUND:: send the task given in XR into the foreground (if caller is parent). I.e. the foreground task of the *STDCIN* stream is set to the given task number, so that job control signals are sent to it.

JC_SUSPEND:: suspend the current task. If the current task is running in the foreground, the parent is becoming the foreground task (i.e. attached to the *STDCIN* stream). Also, sends a *SIG_CONT* to the parent.

JC_SUSPIFBG:: suspend the current task if it is not running in the foreground. Note, this avoids race conditions if a task forks another task and wants to background itself - but the child has already ended.

JC_PAUSE:: pause the current task. The task will be resumed on *JC_BACKGROUND* or *JC_FOREGROUND*, or when a signal is received.

JC_PAUSEIFBG:: pause the current task, if it is not running in the foreground, to avoid race conditions. Task resumes as in *JC_PAUSE*.

JC_INFO:: For the task given in XR, return the number of threads in YR and the TTS status in AC.
