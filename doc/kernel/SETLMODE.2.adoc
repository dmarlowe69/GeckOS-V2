== NAME
SETLMODE - set a stream's line mode and attached foreground process.

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C - 0: only set foreground process if we are the current foreground process; 1: do it anyway
	* AC - line mode to set
	* XR - stream number
	* YR - foreground process attached to stream

Call::
	jsr SETLMODE
Output::
	* C=0: ok
	* C=1: 
		** AC - error code

== DESCRIPTION
Sets the line mode and foreground process attached to a stream. The following list gives the currently defined line modes:

LM_NONE::
	No special handling is performed on SENDCTRL(2).
LM_KEEP::
	Keep the existing line mode, do not change it.
LM_TERM::
	Signals sent with SENDCTRL are forwarded to the attached foreground process 

Note that this function is mainly called from within FORK.

Also, setting the foreground process only succeeds if the current process is the current foreground process.

== RETURN CODES
The call returns without value on success (with C=0), or AC contains one of the following error codes:

E_NOSTR:: 
	XR is not a valid stream
