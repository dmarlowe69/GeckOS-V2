= PSEM2(2)
:doctype: manpage

== NAME
PSEM2 - pass a semaphore.

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C - if set, thread blocks until semaphore aquired, return immediately if clear
	* XR - semaphore number
Call::
	jsr PSEM2
Output::
	* AC - error code (or E_OK)
	* C - set if error code not E_OK

NOTE: YR is preserved, XR is modified.

== DESCRIPTION
Passes a semaphore. The semaphore number can be negative (system semaphore) or positive (application semaphore).

NOTE: The original PSEM had the input of C reversed, i.e. C=0 was blocking. That was in contrast to all (I hope) other occurances where C indicates blocking vs. non-blocking behaviour. This is the only difference.

== RETURN CODES
Error return codes are given when at return, C=1.

E_SEMSET:: 
	semaphore is already set (when not blocking)
E_INT::
        a blocking PSEM2 call was interrupted by a signal handler, while SIG_INT was set.
	On E_INT, the X and Y registers are preserved
