:doctype: manpage

== NAME
GETINFO - get information on the currently running tasks

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C=0 
		** previous task ID in XR, or *TID_START*, to get the information for the task after the given one
	* C=1
		** task ID in XR, for which the data is returned
Call::
	jsr GETINFO
Output::
	* SENDBUF - table with task info
	* C=0 - data is valid (task has been found for both input modes)
	* C=1 - end of list reached, or task ID is invalid.

NOTE: before calling *GETINFO*, the *SEM_SENDBUF* must be passed, and after the information has been read from SENDBUF, SEM_SENDBUF must be freed again.

== DESCRIPTION
Returns a table with information the identified task. 

There is one valid entries in the table, 0 in the TN_NTHREADS field indictaes an unused slot.

----
		ANZ_ENV		12	number of valid entries in SENDBUF

		TN_PID		0	PID of process in this entry
		TN_NTHREADS	1	Number of threads for process
		TN_ENV		2	Environment number for process
		TN_PARENT	3	Parent process
		TN_MEM		4	amount of allocated RAM
		TN_SIGNAL	5	signal handler address
		TN_STDIN	7	STDIN stream
		TN_STDOUT	8	STDOUT stream
		TN_STDERR	9	STDERR stream
		TN_SIGMASK	10	signal mask value
		TN_EXECADDR 	11	start of execution address
		TN_PRIO		13	priority 
		TN_NAME		11	start of prog name (if available)

		TN_SLEN		21	length of struct
----

Each field is TN_SLEN bytes long and the
length of the name field is TNAMLEN. If the name is longer
than TNAMLEN-1, the the last characters are cut off, and in
the table the ending nullbyte is missing.

The task status can be one of the following:

----
/* note: status affects all threads */

TTS_FREE                =0      /* task not used */
TTS_RUN                 =1      /* task has running threads */
TTS_DEAD                =2      /* task is dead, but waiting for CHECKCHILD (NTHREADS=-1) */
TTS_SUSP                =3      /* task is suspended */
TTS_SUSP_ACK            =4      /* task is suspended and has been sent to parent */
TTS_PAUSE               =5      /* task is suspended and waits for a signal */
----

After the Task info, the Thread info is provided for each thread in the task.
The number of threads can be determined by the *TN_NTHREADS* field above. If *TN_NTHREADS* is zero (no threads), or $ff (<-1, task is waiting for parent after it ended), this field gives the right number of returned threads.
The thread structure after *TN_SLEN* is as follows:

----
NT_ID                  =0      /* thread ID                            */
NT_ST                  =1      /* thread state (see TS_* above)        */
NT_SP                  =2      /* thread stack pointer                 */
NT_ADDR                =3      /* return address from stack            */
NT_PAR                 =5      /* three byte thread parameter space    */

NT_SLEN                =8      /* length of entry                      */
----

The thread status can be one of the following:

----
/*        task (thread) state              */

#define   TS_FREE   0
#define   TS_ENV    1   /* allocated but not running            */
#define   TS_IBRK   2   /* task has BRK'd in IRQ routine        */
#define   TS_BRK    3   /* task has BRK'd                       */
#define   TS_RDY    4   /* task did YIELD call                  */
#define   TS_IRQ    5   /* task is interrupted                  */
#define   TS_WFRX   6   /* waiting for other task to RECEIVE    */
#define   TS_WFTX   7   /* waiting for other task to SEND       */
#define   TS_WXTX   8   /* wait for certain task to SEND        */
#define   TS_WFSEM  9   /* wait for semaphore                   */
#define   TS_WSIG   10  /* wait for signal                      */
#define   TS_RUN    11  /* Currently running (GETINFO caller)   */
----
 
To get the information for all tasks, call *GETINFO2* with *C=0* and *TID_START* in XR, and repeat with the PID of the returned task info in XR until C=1.
