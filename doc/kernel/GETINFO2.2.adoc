== NAME
GETINFO - get information on the currently running tasks

== SYNOPSIS
Input::
	* C=0 
		** previous task ID in XR, or *TID_START*, to get the information for the task after the given one
	* C=1
		** task ID in XR, for which the data is returned
Call::
	jsr GETINFO
Output::
	* SENDBUF - table with task info
	* C=0 - data is valid (task has been found for both input modes)
	* C=1 - end of list reached, or task ID is invalid.

NOTE: before calling *GETINFO*, the *SEM_SENDBUF* must be passed, and after the information has been read from SENDBUF, SEM_SENDBUF must be freed again.

== DESCRIPTION
Returns a table with information the identified task. 

There is one valid entries in the table, 0 in the TN_NTHREADS field indictaes an unused slot.

----
		ANZ_ENV		12	number of valid entries in SENDBUF

		TN_PID		0	PID of process in this entry
		TN_NTHREADS	1	Number of threads for process
		TN_ENV		2	Environment number for process
		TN_PARENT	3	Parent process
		TN_MEM		4	amount of allocated RAM
		TN_SIGNAL	5	signal handler address
		TN_STDIN	7	STDIN stream
		TN_STDOUT	8	STDOUT stream
		TN_STDERR	9	STDERR stream
		TN_SIGMASK	10	signal mask value
		TN_EXECADDR 	11	start of execution address
		TN_PRIO		13	priority 
		TN_NAME		11	start of prog name (if available)

		TN_SLEN		21	length of struct
----

Each field is TN_SLEN bytes long and the
length of the name field is TNAMLEN. If the name is longer
than TNAMLEN-1, the the last characters are cut off, and in
the table the ending nullbyte is missing.

To get the information for all tasks, call *GETINFO2* with *C=0* and *TID_START* in XR, and repeat with the PID of the returned task info in XR until C=1.
