== NAME
OS/A65 CS/A65 Notes

== DESCRIPTION
The CS/A65 is basically a PET clone with the option to use many more I/O boards
pluggable into the computer's backplane.
In addition, the computer has an MMU, that maps each of the 16 4k-blocks in the CPU address space to any of 256 blocks in a 1MB bus address space.
There typically a 512k RAM is available instead of the 32k of the PET.

This port is thus based on the PET 32k port regarding the types of devices and interrupt handling. But the memory management is considerably different.
One main difference is that every task gets its own memory setup, with its own zeropage and stack that is thus not shared as in some other ports.

== Initial Memory Map

As every task can have its own memory, in the initial memory map only the lowest 4k are allocated for a task. In the upper region, kernel
and lib6502 are mapped, leaving about 48000 bytes for a task.

Lib6502 malloc uses the SBRK system call to allocate additional memory pages if memory needs to be allocated for a task (e.g. when it is loaded)

== BUILDING
Building the 8x96 ROM image is simple. Just go to the arch/csa65/boot
directory and type "make". This should build all files.
"make osa.d64" should make a d64 VC1541 disk image with all necessary files.
You have to have my new XA version in the path, though.

To customize the ROM, change edit rom.a65 in arch/cbm8x96. You can gain some
memory when you remove the shell/monitor from the ROM image.
(You could replace it with the lib6502 monitor "mon" to be loaded like
"lsh".)
When running "make" then the command "file65" should print the addresses
used for the different segments. They must not overlap. 

To move the lib6502 RAM area, edit the values for +Memstart, Memend+
and +Zerostart+ at the end of rom.a65.
To move the segments, edit the Makefile and change the addresses for the 
segments in the XA calls. The text segment address must be two below
the actual start as it also counts the two byte starting address used
for loading. In addition you have to edit the value for the definition
of ROMSTART in rom.a65.

=== BOOT
Put the files "loader", "lsh", "rom.bin", "lib.bin" and "kern.bin" on a disk accessible by the 
CS/A. Load "loader" into BASIC memory and start it (probably edit 
it for the right load device number). This boots OS/A65.
