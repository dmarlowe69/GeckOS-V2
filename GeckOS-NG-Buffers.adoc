== High Level Goal

Unify SEND/RECEIVE and Streams with a buffer-oriented communications API,
that specifically allows for shared memory streams and optimizes the
number of kernel calls.

== Concepts

These concepts are preliminary and the discussion documented here is basically 
a scratchpad of ideas that will be further refined, and at some point implemented.

=== Buffers

The Buffers interface replaces the SEND/RECEIVE and Streams APIs at the same time.

The main concept of the API is the Buffer. A buffer is a memory area 
that is defined by a start address, a length, and a type that defines
how read and write pointers, as well as changes to start address and length
are handled.

The following types are defined:
1. message - this buffer will be atomically sent as one set of bytes, and receives sets of bytes atomically. This replaces the SEND/RECEIVE API
2. ring - this buffer works as a ring buffer, similarly to the kernel buffers used in V2. This replaces the current Streams API
3. rwbuf - a memory buffer that is being read from or written to. The extends to Streams API so that file servers can directly write to target environment instead of going through the kernel with every byte (zero-copy load)
4. mmap - a shared memory area between two tasks/environments. This allows for disk servers to provide shared buffers to file servers.

NOTE: a *file server* is what is today implemented in e.g. FSDEV and FSIEC, providing file system services to other processes. A *disk server* is a new type of process, that provides block-oriented access to partitions, disk images etc. A FAT file server could for example use an SCSI disk server to provide file systems from a SCSI disk partition.

.Buffer definition

As the 6502 does not have enough and not large enough registers to give address and length of a buffer and further parameters in a single call, a separate *buffer definition block* is used to define a buffer:

* 0/1: address of buffer (2 bytes)
* 2/3: length of buffer (2 bytes)
* 4: type of buffer (1 byte)
* 5: buffer flags (1 byte)
* (6/7: amount of data stored - see API)

This buffer definition is given to the kernel once, and is then used throughout
the communication in the channel (see below).

.Memory mapping

A buffer can be - if appropriate flags are given - re-defined by the kernel.
This allows the kernel for example to map buffers in two tasks into the same
memory area - so no copying is required for the actual data transfer.

=== Channel

Channels replace streams. Once a communication is established and the
buffer is given to the kernel, only the channel number is used for further calls.

The kernel maintains two buffers for each channel - one for the sender, one for the receiver.
The sender writes data into its own buffer, then tells the kernel how many bytes are written.
The kernel then copies the data over to the receiver buffer. When the receiver
calls the kernel, it gets the amount of data that it can read from the buffer.

If specific flags are given (tbd), the kernel can re-map the buffer, and overwrite
the buffer definition block address and length. The reason is that re-mapping
read- and write buffers to the same address allows for zero-copy loading or saving of 
data from/to devices.

=== Ports

A process can register a port number with the kernel. This port number can be looked
up using the locator API, and is then used to send a message to that process.

This way a process can register multiple ports for multiple services.

== Compatibility

The streams API - GETSTR, GETC, PUTC, FRESTR, UNGETC - will be re-created for 
buffers to allow simple migration.

The SEND/RECEIVE API will be replaced with a new API.

== APIs

=== SEND/RECEIVE

PCONNECT:: send a message to another task - initiate a SEND/RECEIVE channel.
	The (best/only?) supported buffer type is the Message buffer.
	PCONNECT blocks until the message has been fully taken out of the buffer.
	Further communication on that channel is then done by using CPUSH and CPULL.
	Input:::
	* AC/YR - address of buffer definition block
	* XR - target port number
	Output:::
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
			*** E_ILLPAR - not a valid port number (not open for listening)
			*** E_INT - the call has been interrupted by a signal
				(semantics / preserved registers to be defined)
	* C=0 - success
		** XR - channel number to use for further communication

PLISTEN:: register a port
	Input:::
		* none
	Output:::
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
	* C=0 - success
		** XR - port number to use for further communication

PACCEPT:: bind a buffer to an incoming port send (PCONNECT) request.
	Copy the initial message to the receiver buffer. The (best/only?) supported
	buffer type is the Message buffer.
	Further communication on that channel is then done by using CPUSH and CPULL.
	Input:::
	* AC/YR - address of buffer definition block
	* XR - port number
	Output:::
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
			*** E_ILLPAR - not a valid port number or port already in use (another process waiting)
			*** E_INT - the call has been interrupted by a signal
				(semantics / preserved registers to be defined)
	* C=0 - success
		** XR - channel number to use for further communication

PCLOSE:: close a port
	Input:::
	* XR - port number
	* C=1 - error
		** AC - error code
			*** E_ILLPAR - not a valid port number or port already closed
	Output:::
	* C=0 - success

		** AC - error code

CPUSH:: send bytes in buffer to other end
	Input:::
		** XR - channel number
		** AC - number of bytes to be sent
	Output:::
	* C=0 - success
		** AC - number of bytes the receiver has already taken from the local buffer since the last call
	* C=1 
		** AC - error code

CPULL:: get bytes from other end into buffer
	Input:::
		** XR - channel number
		** AC - number of bytes to acknowledge (that have been read) since the last call
	Output:::
	* C=0 - success
		** AC - number of bytes that have been transferred to the local buffer
	* C=1 
		** AC - error code


== Buffer types

Four different buffer types can be used. Each buffer type works differently. The behaviour of each buffer type is described below

=== Message buffers

The Message buffer is a buffer that does an "all or nothing" approach when sending (CPUSH) or receiving (CPULL). It is used
to replace the "PCBUF" used for sending and receiving in V1 and V2. 



=== Ring buffers

A Ring buffer allows continuous streaming, using a read and a write pointer that wrap around at the end of the buffer's size.



=== Uni buffers

An Uni buffer is a unidirectional, single use buffer that is read or written once. After that the channel is either closed, or the buffer
needs to be re-defined with CBUF.
This is used for example to load data from a file or store data in a file.



=== Mapped buffers

A Mapped buffer allows direct intercommunication between two processes through a memory mapped area.


== Buffer remapping

To allow for optimized, if possible even zero-copy loads across environments, if a process is prepared for it,
the channel buffer can be re-mapped by the kernel.

1) flag to be set in CBUF to enable this feature

2) specific return value for CPUSH/CPULL to then call CBUF again

== Implementation guidelines

In V1 and V2, the kernel manages a single, internal ring buffer to transfer bytes with streams.
In V3, the kernel manages multiple buffer definition blocks - one for reading and one or potentially more
for writing.

When the channel is created, an internal ring buffer is allocated and set as read buffers.
This channel is being used by CPUT and CGET.
