== High Level Goal

Provide a "locator" service that replaces the FSM filesystem locator with
a generic solution that can be used to lookup real names, and other types of
elements. Use this to map drive names like "fd0", "8", or "sda1" to 
drive numbers and server process ids. Also, this is the means to identify
and address dynamically changing devices, like USB-connected mice or keyboards,
or storage. It could also be used to identify networking devices.
