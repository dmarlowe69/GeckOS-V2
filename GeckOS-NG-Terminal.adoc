== High Level Goal

Establish the concept of a controlling terminal, that receives
signals like Ctrl-C or Ctrl-Z from devices. This would also enable job control in the
shell - that at this point can only wait for a child to end, or send it
in the background altogether. In addition, an (optional) terminal process will be established that allows windowing of shells - similar to Linux tmux as an example.
